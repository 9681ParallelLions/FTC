        <h2 class="purple-text">Amar Jyoti School</h2>
        <p class = "purple-text flow-text"> Some of our members came from First Lego League last year and so they already had some exposure to the core values and heavy emphasis on Outreach and spreading the words of robotics and computer science in our communities. Before we even joined FTC and learned of the Outreach that most teams do during their season, we knew we wanted to continue “Outreaching” due to the heavy impact that FLL had on us. So, a few of us got together and decided on a plan. One member from our team went to Delhi, India to teach in a school for underprivileged and disabled children. While he started out by teaching them English and Mathematics, he quickly transitioned into teaching Computer Science and Robotics. We believe that proper STEM education should be available to everyone in this world, no matter where they’re from or how they live. This team member, Pratham, was determined to work towards this goal, which was a big one, but it needed a start. So, he began working with a small group of children and teaching them basic computer science principles, beginning with Scratch to introduce the concepts of “if-else” statements and conditional loops and then moving on to simple HTML. When he thought they were ready, pratham signed up the children for a local “computer contest” where they had to demonstrate proficiency in things like using Microsoft word, excel and powerpoint, and also the ability to make a simple Scratch skit where speech bubbles appear in front of characters and sounds are played. This team won their local tournament, which is comparable to our Regional tournaments in FTC. This allowed them to move on to the All-India level, with all the best teams. This would be comparable to a Super-Regional FTC tournament. At this tournament, competitors were expected to write more complicated Scratch scripts such as games or longer skits, where signals had to be broadcasted and received between different scripts and the users had to be able to control the characters in the games or influence the story in the skits through typed user input. At this tournament as well, the team won various awards, thanks to the coaching from Pratham and the countless hours and hard work put in by the students themselves. Their team was invited to a World Championship Tournament in China. This is comparable to FTC Worlds. Unfortunately, Pratham could not be in India and then travel to China with the team, as he had to return to the US for the school year, but he was determined to stay involved and stayed in touch with the team via Skype. When he returned from his trip, Pratham talked with his teammates and they decided to expand this program even further. Through some of the connections he made in India, Pratham was able talk to the Amar Jyoti School administration to form a program where students from our FTC team can video chat with students there who are interested in computer science to give them lessons in advanced HTML, basic java, and other computer science disciplines. Four members of our team, Reha, Shrey, Pratham, and Rohan, are fluent in Hindi and are able to act as translators when students are having trouble communicating. We were really inspired by the drive that the students at Amar Jyoti school had to learn about STEM, regardless of the countless obstacles they had in their way, such as their economic status or their disabilities. We especially inspired by one child, named Subhash, who was so dedicated to computer science that, regardless of the fact that he had no arms, came to school everyday and typed computer code with his feet. We admired how they overcame the most of adversities and we decided we needed to share this drive with even more people and we also knew that this is a great pathway for expanding STEM education throughout communities where people might not usually have access to it. We have decided to take more people back to this school in India this coming summer, and to start an official club at school so that we can gain more students from our school who want to be “teachers” and teach STEM and spread the extensively useful knowledge about the topics of Computer Science and Robotics.

        <p class = "purple-text flow-text">	On November 18, we hosted a bake sale in front of our cafeteria to support a growing FLL team from George Jackson Academy. Everyone from each of our three teams contributed to the bake sale by either bringing in food to sell or manning the desks. We had a large variety of food at the bake sale including crème brûlée and various cookies. We raised a lot of money during it and was able to allow George Jackson to have a great starting point in their robotics team. In fact, we had exceeded our goals and were able to get more tools for them than expected.

        <p class = "purple-text flow-text">We helped George Jackson Academy, an elementary/middle school that has been trying to set up a robotics team, but lacks the resources. On their first visit to Horace Mann we gave them a tour around our building and showed them our robots and building processes. They also came to look at the different robots that teams had made for the FLL competition. The kids visit our school monthly and we provide them with the tools they need to help their team thrive. They were all passionate in robotics, and we wish them a bright future in their coming robotics endeavours!

        <h2 class="purple-text">Kindergarten</h2>
        <p class = "purple-text flow-text">	Every Monday, during their free periods, members from our team will visit the  Horace Mann kindergarten in the lower division and help the robotics teacher teach the kids some programming. This is very important because it is giving the kindergartners a very early exposure to programming, which is an extremely useful skill in this age of computers and robotics. Even though they are using very simple tools, it is much more than any of us have gotten when we were that young.

        <p class = "purple-text flow-text">	On February 4th, our school hosted an FLL qualifier in our cafeteria and in our classrooms. Due to the increase of interest in FLL, FIRST hosted 4 amazing competitions to accommodate. All of the Horace Mann Teams – FTC 9681, FTC 7890, FTC 4326 and FRC 5806 –volunteered for various jobs in the competition, including judging, queueing, refereeing, scorekeeping, and running the event in general.
