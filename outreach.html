        <p class = "purple-text flow-text">	On November 18, we hosted a bake sale in front of our cafeteria to support a growing FLL team from George Jackson Academy. Everyone from each of our three teams contributed to the bake sale by either bringing in food to sell or manning the desks. We had a large variety of food at the bake sale including crème brûlée and various cookies. We raised a lot of money during it and was able to allow George Jackson to have a great starting point in their robotics team. In fact, we had exceeded our goals and were able to get more tools for them than expected.
